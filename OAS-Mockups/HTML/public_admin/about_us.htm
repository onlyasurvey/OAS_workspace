                     <p>Only A Survey was created to allow any organization to create and deploy accessible and secure surveys using a simple accessible interface.</p>
                     <h3>Why we started:</h3>
                     <p>Mark Mckay our co-founder and lead designer needed a survey tool to run  a survey on his web site SpokenText.net. His site allows anyone to  easily convert text content to speech and transfer it to their iPod.  His site has a lot of disabled users so he wanted to post an accessible  survey on his site, to learn why his users were visiting his site and  find better ways to serve them.</p>
                     <p>Mark Mckay is an expert in the area of accessible interface design and  reviewed over 10 of the leading online survey tools and to his dismay  found that not one was fully accessible to the disabled. And few would  be usable at all for a disabled person who wanted to create a survey  for their own web site or blog.&nbsp;&nbsp;  So he set out to create OnlyASurvey.com, the simple, accessible and secure survey tool.</p>
                     <h3> OnlyASurvey.com is:</h3>
                     <ul>
                       <li> simple to use</li>
                       <li> accessible to all</li>
                       <li> compliant with CLF 2, 508 and EU standards for accessibility</li>
                       <li> secure</li>
                       <li> easy to export your data to Excel for complex analysis</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>We hope you enjoy using it as much as we did creating it! </p>
